    review: `Even though my car is brand new, Nik took it to a whole new level. I honestly didn’t think it could look better than when I drove it off the lot, but after his detail, it’s flawless. His work easily outperformed the dealership’s so called "new car detail". He was punctual, professional, and incredibly meticulous. Every surface, inside and out, was cleaned and polished to perfection. The paint looks deeper and richer, and the interior feels fresher and more refined than ever. If you’re looking for someone who truly knows what they’re doing and pays attention to every detail, Nik is the one to call. Outstanding work! Highly recommended!`,

Recommended a higher level of service than I originally requested but, also showed the grit and I was able to feel the imperfections. Huge difference in the gloss , finish, and water now runs of the vehicle. White leather interior was clean and conditioned. Car looking like new again. I honestly didn’t want to drive it and get it dirty …. LOL.HIGHLY recommended and I’ll be sending referrals.`,
